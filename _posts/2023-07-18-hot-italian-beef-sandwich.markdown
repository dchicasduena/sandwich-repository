I have been watching The Bear (2022) lately and want to try the sandwich so bad

## ingredients - sandwich

- 1 (2-pound) roast of top sirloin or top round, trimmed of fat
- kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- oil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 onion, quartered
- 1 celery
- 1 carrot
- 1 quart reduced-sodium beef stock
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon red chili flakes
- 4 sandwich rolls, preferably Turano, Gonnella or Amoroso, or 3 soft baguettes cut into thirds
- 1 quart giardiniera

## ingredients - giardiniera

- 1 green bell peppers
- 1 red bell peppers
- 1 jalapeño 
- 1 celery
- 1 carrot
- 1 small onion
- 1/2 cup of cailiflower
- 1/2 cup of salt
- green olives (to preference)
- clove of garlic
- dried oregano
- red pepper flakes
- black pepper
- 1/4 cup of white vinegar
- 1/4 cup of olive oil

## steps -  sandwich

- heat the oven to 350 degrees
- pat the beef dry with paper towels, in a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon of the salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper
- sprinkle the mixture all over the roast and use your hands to rub the seasoning into the meat on all sides,
in a large, heavy-bottom, oven-proof pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat
- add the roast and brown well on all sides, using tongs to turn it as needed, 7 to 10 minutes total, remove the meat from the pan and rest it on a plate, leave any rendered fat in the pan.
- add the garlic, celery, carrots and onion to the pan and stir vigorously with a spoon until very fragrant and just barely beginning to brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute, being careful not to let it burn., immediately pour in the beef stock, and with a wooden spoon scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any stuck-on bits of beef
- stir in the oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, crushed chili flakes, salt and pepper
- return the beef to the pan and turn it a few times in the broth to moisten it all over, slide the pan into the oven and cook, covered with aluminum foil, until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 125 to 150 degrees, about 25-30 minutes
- remove from oven, let cool and then chill the beef in the braising liquid — pan and all — in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight
- remove from refrigerator and, if desired, skim the layer of fat from the top and discard, while still cold, transfer the roast to a cutting board and use a large, sharp knife to slice the entire roast as thinly as possible — ⅛ inch thick or less (the thinner, the better)
- meanwhile, return the pan with the jus to the stovetop over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer, place the sliced meat in the pan with the jus and cook gently until the beef is warmed through and no longer pink, 10 to 12 minutes
- in the meantime, heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment, slice the rolls lengthwise, partway but not all of the way through the equator, leaving the top and bottom attached to each other with a 1- to 2-inch “hinge” 
- lay the rolls on the parchment, open side down. Toast them in the oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes
- to assemble the sandwiches, hold a roll in the palm of one hand with the opening facing up and the hinge resting in your palm, holding the roll over the pan of meat, use tongs to lift a few slices of beef out of the jus and nestle them into the roll
- allow for plenty of jus to moisten the bread, spooning more of the liquid over the meat if the bread is too dry, fill each roll with as much of the beef as you can fit — and then add a little more
- garnish with giardiniera to taste.

## steps -  giardiniera

- dice all your vegetables
- put all your vegetables in a bowl and stir in the salt and fill with enough water to cover
- cover with plastic wrap and chill in fridge overnight
- drain water and rinse vegetables
- mix the rest of ingriedients with your vegetables in a bowl, pour vinegar and oil then mix well, put in a jar and refrigerate for two days before using
